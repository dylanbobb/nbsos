# No Bullshit Operating System (NBSOS)

A unix-like operating system written in C++
Lightweight and not packed will bullshit.
Slowly working on this to learn while I have some free time.

This is still a very early stage project.
Build instructions coming soon.
Run this OS at your own risk!

For now I'm heavily basing myself off of: https://github.com/AlgorithMan-de/wyoos
But I plan to branch quite durastically once the ground work is layed out.
